# Project Plan

## Overview

The aim of our project is to derive insights about food distribution and the availability of healthy eating options in the US using data from the USDA Food Environment Atlas, supplemented with data from the USDA Branded Food Products Database.

The Food Environment Atlas contains data at the county level and has many features, including access to restaurants, grocery stores, farmers markets and welfare programs, as well as demographic and health data. The Food Products Database contains the nutritional composition of branded and private-label foods.

We plan to produce a web app that features an interactive map of the US to visually display food access data, and a prediction calculator.

## Task Timeline

We’ve decided to work concurrently on the various tasks required for our project, and have allocated the next four weeks to:

-   **Week 1**: We plan to spend the majority of week one exploring the datasets, refining the questions we’d like the data to answer, and identifying the variables that we’ll use in our model. We’ll also spend some time building the basic US map visualization and scaffolding out the web app.

-   **Week 2**: This week will be spent working with Tableau to help us visualize the data, and building the model that that app will use. We’ll also decide on the exact D3 visualizations that we will include.

-   **Week 3**: Populate the map visualization and build and test the prediction calculator.

-   **Week 4**: Finalize the visualizations, trying to use the data to tell a cohesive story.

## Roles and Responsibilities

We plan to use a [trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/nV0Dk09z/14cb1550724df0a1790802d0c9cb6402/e14a-team-project) to keep track of our assigned tasks. We’ll also check in during weekly meetings, and communicate via Slack.

As a group, we are all very interested in diving into the data science aspect of this project, so all four of us will collaborate on that. Additionally, Tushal Desai and Gabe Mansur will handle back-end development, and Rachael Serur and Rebecca Larson will focus on data visualization.
